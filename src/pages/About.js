        <p className='text-sky-900'> 
        Doctors: It's important for us to have qualified and experienced homeopathic doctors on staff to ensure that patients receive proper treatment. We may want to consider hiring doctors with a variety of specialties, such as pediatrics or dermatology, to offer a wide range of services.

        Medicine: Homeopathic medicine relies on natural remedies and ingredients, so it's important for us to stock our hospital with high-quality, pure medicines that are free from contaminants. We may want to work with a trusted supplier or manufacturer to ensure that our medicines meet the necessary standards.
        
        Shop: In addition to offering medical services, we may want to consider opening a shop where patients can purchase homeopathic remedies, books, and other health-related products. This can help generate additional revenue for our hospital while also providing patients with access to the tools they need to maintain their health.
        
        Books: It's important for us to have a variety of books on homeopathy and related topics available for patients and staff to read. This can help promote education and understanding about homeopathic medicine, as well as provide a resource for patients who may want to learn more about their conditions and treatment options.
